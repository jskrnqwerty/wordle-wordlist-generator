Enters, Wordle Helper_4.3

About Wordle:
Guess the WORDLE in six tries.
Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
After each guess, the color of the tiles change to show how close your guess was to the word.
Examples
The letter W is GREEN  : It's in the correct spot.
The letter I is YELLOW : It's in the wrong spot.
The letter U is GREY   : It's not in the word in any spot.

About the program:
- The program is written in Python.
- I've tried to add as many comments in the code as I thought made sense.
- Wordle_Helper_v4.3.py file executes the program.
- After trying the first 5-letter word on you own, enter the output into the command line after execution.
- Instructions for inputting word in command line are as follows:
    - You enter each letter one at a time.
    - Input is not case sensitive.
    - Each letter's colour is to be indicated by adding a designated suffix.
        - for Green  -> 'g'
        - for Yellow -> 'y'
        - for Grey   -> ''
        - For 'H' in GREEN square : hg
        - For 'E' in YELLOW square: ey
        - For 'L' in GREY square  : l
        - For 'L' in GREEN square : lg
        - for 'O' in GREY square  : o
